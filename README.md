# iCurl

iCurl (Interactive Curl) is a simple tool that allows you to use the well known command line tool curl in a interactive way. <br>
Curl can be used to send and receive data, manage cookies, download files (...) via many different protocols (e.g. HTTP,FTP,LDAP) and is widely used in web programming to automate HTTP requests and interact with web API services. <br>
iCurl was born to simplify all these operations through the user interaction, especially for who is not very familiar with the command line arguments. <br><br>

## Please note
This is a LITE version: it means that it doesn't support all the operation that curl can natively does, actually it works just for basic HTTP requests. <br>
